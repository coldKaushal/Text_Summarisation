In this project we made use of the natural language processing to summarise the text. the project uses various phases of NLP and exploit best practices to create a NLP model. 
The details about every step are attached in the google colab notebook.

Steps to run the program:
* Open the colab notebook link
* login to the google account
* To run all cells at once press ctrl + F9 or run individual cell one by one

The project uses a predefined text to show the working of the model. However the user can change the text in the program itself.
